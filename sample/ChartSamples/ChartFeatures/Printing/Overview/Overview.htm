		<P>The Chart control uses the Chart.Printing property (a PrintManager object) for 
            printing charts. When a chart is printed, all chart elements except for scrollbars will be 
			printed. The PrintManager object has&nbsp;the following methods that are used for basic 
				printing operations:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					PageSetup: displays a Page Setup dialog, which allows for paper size 
				selection, paper source, orientation, etc.
				<LI>
					PrintPreview: displays a Print Preview dialog, which allows the 
				end-user to zoom, print the chart, etc.
				<LI>
					Print: prints the 
    chart, and the Print dialog can optionally be displayed prior to 
    printing.</LI></UL>
			<P>Use the PrintingManager property when you need to perform more advanced printing 
                tasks, such as a setting margins programmatically.</P>
			<H4>Custom Printing</H4>
				<P>Use the PrintDocument.PrintPage event to perform custom painting. To embed 
                    multiple charts in the same printed document, call the Chart.Printing.PrintPaint 
                    method for each Chart control in the event callback for PrintPage.</P>
