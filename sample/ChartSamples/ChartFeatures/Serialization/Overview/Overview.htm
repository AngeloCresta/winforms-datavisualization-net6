            Serialization involves the saving of chart properties, usually to disk. 
            Deserialization&nbsp;involves&nbsp;the&nbsp;retrieval of&nbsp;serialized data, followed by 
            the&nbsp;loading of this data&nbsp;into the Chart control.</p>
        <p>
            Serialization enables you to persist and reuse a chart&#39;s appearance properties 
            and data. This can save you time when you regularly create charts with the same 
            appearance settings or from a specific data set.</p>
        <p>
            Serialization&nbsp;is accomplished using a ChartSerializer object. You can access it 
            via the Chart.Serializer property.</p>

            Format of Serialized Data</h3>

            <p>
                The format of serialized data can be either XML or Binary. The advantage of XML 
                is that serialized data is readable, while the advantage of binary is that the 
                serialized data takes less storage space.</p>

                There are three methods by which chart data can be marked as serializable:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Without explicitly specifying any serializable properties. This causes all chart 
                    properties with non-default values (including chart data) to be serialized.</li>
                <li>Setting the Content property. This groups the chart properties to be serialized 
                    into categories (data, appearance, and so on). </li>
                <li>Set the SerializableContent property, which is a comma-separated list of all 
                    chart properties to be serialized.</li>

                Non-serializable properties are set using the NonSerializableContent property. 
                This is a comma-separated listing of all chart properties not to be serialized, 
                and wildcards can be used in the string expression (in the same manner as the 
                SerializableContent property).</p>

<H3>Resetting Chart Properties</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
		<P>When chart data is saved, only properties that do 
  not have default values are serialized. This reduces the amount of saved data. Therefore it is possible for a serializable property to not be saved, and 
  during a load operation by default this property will be reset to its default 
  value. Set the ResetWhenLoading 
			property to <b>False</b> if you do not wish to reset non-default data that is 
            serializable but unserialized.
