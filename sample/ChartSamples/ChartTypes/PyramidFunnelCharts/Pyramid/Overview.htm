			The pyramid chart is used to display data that adds up to 100%.
		</P>
		<P>Each data point of the funnel chart may have a label. The position of the labels 
			is controlled by the PyramidLabelStyle custom attribute, which can be set on 
			the series or on the data point:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			OutsideInColumn: This is the default label style. Labels are outside of the 
			pyramid and form a column on one side. The callout line connects the label with 
			the point.&nbsp;
			<LI>
			Outside: Labels are placed close to the edge on the outside of the 
			pyramid.&nbsp;
			<LI>
			Inside: Labels are placed inside the pyramid segments.&nbsp;
			<LI>
				Disabled: Labels are not shown.
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>The PyramidOutsideLabelPlacement custom attribute defines if the outside labels 
			are drawn on the left or right side. The PyramidInsideLabelAlignment attribute 
			defines the vertical alignment of the data point labels when the label style is 
			set to Inside. The CalloutLineColor attribute sets the line color used in 
			conjunction with the OutsideInColumn label style.
		</P>
		<P>The PyramidPointGap attribute allows the developer to separate each segment of 
			the funnel with a point gap. The size of the gap is in relative coordinates. 
			The gap size will automatically be restricted so that all points fit into the 
			plotting area.
		</P>
		<P>The PyramidMinPointHeight attribute sets the minimum height of the segment. This 
			attribute reduces the display of very thin segments.
		</P>
		<P>When working with data that contains large discrepancies between values, it is 
			recommended that the developer use a logarithmic scale. The pyramid chart type 
			is useful for representing this kind of data. A logarithmic scale can be added 
			by setting the Logarithmic property of the ChartArea class. Negative Y values 
			are always treated as being positive.
		</P>
		<P>A 3D pyramid can be displayed by setting the Enable3D property of the ChartArea 
			class. The angle of rotation is controlled by the Pyramid3DRotationAngle custom 
			attribute and can be in the range of -10 to 10 degrees. The 
			Pyramid3DDrawingStyle custom attribute can define the shape of the pyramid base 
			and can be set to CircularBase or SquareBase.
		</P>
		<P>The relative size of each pyramid segment is calculated based on the value of 
			the PyramidValueType property:&nbsp;</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Linear: Each data point value is displayed relative to the height of each 
			pyramid segment.&nbsp;
			<LI>
				Surface: Each data point value is displayed relative to the surface area of 
				each pyramid segment.</LI></UL>
