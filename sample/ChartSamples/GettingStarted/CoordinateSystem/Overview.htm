            The coordinate system of the Chart control is <i>relative</i>.&nbsp;Using relative 
            coordinates ensures that chart objects remain relative to one another&nbsp;when the 
            chart is resized, making positioning and sizing easier.</p>
        <p>
            The&nbsp;coordinate system has its origin in the upper-left corner with the X axis 
            pointing to the right and the Y axis pointing down (see the figure below).&nbsp;For 
            3D charts the direction of the Z axis is outward (going out of the page).</p>

        <p>
            Coordinates are always expressed as a percentage of the&nbsp;element they are being 
            applied to.</p>
        <p>
            The coordinate system is applied to two types of objects:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Entire chart&nbsp;picture.</li>
            <li>All chart areas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            Chart Picture</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                Coordinate values are measured as a percentage of the chart picture&#39;s width and 
                height.&nbsp;The top-left corner has the coordinates (0,0), and the bottom-right 
                corner has the coordinates (100,100).</p>
            <p>
                The chart picture&#39;s coordinate system determines the position of chart area 
                objects and&nbsp;legend objects (if the legends are not displayed within a chart 
                area).</p>

            Chart Areas</h3>
        <blockquote dir="ltr">
            <p>
                Coordinate values are measured as a percentage of the chart area&#39;s width and

                corner has the coordinates (100,100).</p>

                A&nbsp;chart area&#39;s coordinate system determines the position of all objects 
                contained within it, such as labels and annotations.</p>
