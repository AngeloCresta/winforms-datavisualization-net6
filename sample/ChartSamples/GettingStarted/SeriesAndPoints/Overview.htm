                        Series and Chart Type</H3>
		<P>Each series has a ChartType property, which determines the type of 
			chart type that is plotted, such as Pie, Line, and so on.</P>

		<H3>Series and Data Points</H3>
		<p>
			A data series is a related 
			group of data points. A data point 
			contains X, Y, and appearance values. Depending on the chart type, it may 
			contain multiple Y values.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;each point in a Candlestick 
			chart contains a high, low, open and close value (see the figure below).

		<h3>
			            Appearance Properties</h3>
		<p>
            Series, like many other Chart elements, support a wide variety of appearances 
            including the following:s</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradient colors, with a variety of styles. </li>
            <li>Hatching, with a variety of patterns. </li>
            <li>Background images.Transparency, set using an alpha value.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>Series can have an unlimited number of data points, which&nbsp;also have their own 
            appearance properties, such as gradient colors, hatching, and transparency. The 
            appearance properties of a data point takes precedence over the same properties 
            of the data point&#39;s owning series. The figure below demonstrates this 
            granularity.</p>
