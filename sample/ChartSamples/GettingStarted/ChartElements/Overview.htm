            A chart consists of numerous elements, all of which are accessible via the Chart 
            control API. The Chart control API is object-oriented, extensible and highly 
            flexible. It also supports an unlimited number of key chart elements such as 
            data series, data points in a series, chart areas, and so on.</p>
        <p>
            The following figure illustrates the key elements that constitute a chart:</p>

            <p>
                The chart picture consists of one or more chart areas, which are&nbsp;rectangular 
                areas that are used to draw series, labels, axes, grid lines, tick marks, and so 
                on. Multiple&nbsp;series can be plotted in one chart area, depending on the chart 
                types involved.</p>
            <p>
                The plot area, used to plot chart data,&nbsp;is also contained within a chart area.</p>
            <h4>
                Chart Picture</h4>
            <p>
                The chart picture, is the entire image surface that is rendered by the Chart 
                control.&nbsp;It&nbsp;corresponds to the root Chart object.</p>

                all drawn outside of the plotting area and inside the chart area. The plot area 
                can be set via the ChartArea.InnerPlotPosition property.</p>
            <h4>
